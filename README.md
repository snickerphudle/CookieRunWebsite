This [Cookie Run website](http://williampnguyen.com/CookieRunWebsite/) is a website about the game Cookie Run Ovenbreak that I created in HTML and CSS during my freshman year of high school. The website contains an overview of the game, basic gameplay, a list of all pets and cookies, and lands included in the game.

Note: I do not own any of the image or video files in this repo. The only things I own are the HTML and CSS files used to create the website. All credit is attributed in the website in the footers of each page under the word ["sources"](https://snickerphudle.github.io/cookierun.github.io/sources.html).
